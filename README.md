# Camp-Assessment

Create, document and test the following program

Tane runs a school holiday camp for 5- to 17-year-olds. If they are at least 15 years old, they can be offered a leadership role at the camp.
There are the following options for the camp:
  •	Cultural immersion. This is for 5 days and is considered “easy” and costs $800
  •	Kayaking and pancakes. This is for 3 days and is considered “moderate” and costs $400
  •	Mountain biking. This is for 4 days and is considered “difficult” and costs $900

Campers can make their own way to the camp or get the shuttle bus for $80.
There is an option for standard meals, vegetarian or vegan.

The program needs to ask suitable questions. 
In a single formatted sentence, it needs to say the campers name, age, number of days, chosen camp, difficulty level, meal choice.
Give the total cost and confirm if they are attending or not, then print their decision.

You also need to include comments and test the program works as expected
